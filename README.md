# lost-programming-language
Hey folks, check it out—I'm diving into that ambitious journey every seasoned coder dreams of: crafting my own programming language. I've named it "Lost," not because I've lost my rizz or anything, but because it's gearing up to be both straightforward and powerful.

Just so you're in the loop, I'm doing this for the sheer thrill of it. If it starts resembling a coding marathon, I might tap out. And here's the kicker—I'm giving it an English flair because, why not? English is my vibe.

Officially kicked off this language venture just a couple of days ago. Progress report: I've got a variable and the print function down. Sounds basic, I know, but Rome wasn't built in a day. Here's a snippet to give you a taste of the code vibes:

variable number is set to 20 
write: number plus number 


output: 
40 

well...sure...it has a longer compared coding time than.....lets say - python

number = 20
print(number + number)


output:
40

But come on...simplicity in a programming language always comes with costs right? And the language is based on English grammar so it's supposed to be long for the grammar to be correct.

Oh, and in case you're wondering, I'm even cooking up an IDE for it. Yeah, I'm making moves.
Stay tuned for more coding sagas, or not—life's a wild ride, am I right? 😜✌️
